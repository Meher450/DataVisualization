# 🚢 Indian Ports & Fleet Performance Analysis

A comprehensive data analytics project using Python to explore, visualize, and forecast trends in Indian maritime operations — covering cargo traffic, fleet growth, port performance, and more.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing large Excel datasets
- Handling missing data with randomized imputation
- Visualizing insights using matplotlib and seaborn
- Predicting future vessel growth using linear regression
- Comparing performance across major Indian ports

---

## 📁 Dataset Summary

The project uses multiple Excel sheets that include:
- Major and Non-Major Port Traffic
- Fleet Growth Since 1947
- GRT Trends (Coastal vs Overseas)
- Turnaround Time and Berth Productivity
- Age-wise Distribution of Vessels
